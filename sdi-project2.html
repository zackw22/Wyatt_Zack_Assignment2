<p>I decided to switch my story this week because I struggled to get my previous story to fit in to this flow chart for this week.</p>
<p>The story I chose for this week was about what I currently do as my job at work. Since I work with different mobile platforms, I thought that it would work well with the arrays function.</p>
<p>I feel like maybe I am getting a little better at this. The week prior was a struggle for me. I hope that this comes out much better.</p>
